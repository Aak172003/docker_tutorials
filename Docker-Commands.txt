1. docker ps
This will show which image is running ( it called as container )


1. docker build .
or if i want to give custom name to my image 
docker build -t image_name .

2. docker image ls
This will give the list of all Docker Images

3. docker stop image_Name
This is used to stop the container running status

4. docker run image_id
This is used to run any docker image , But This will give error ( because localhoast can't able to access port where my application is running )


To resolve this error, we need to use port binding

This is Port Binding ( through which i can able to access port where my application is running )
5. docker run -p container_port:application_port image_id

But with this i can able to execute any other cmd on same terminal ( so , to fix this i use deteched method )
6. docker run -d -p container_port:application_port image_id


7. docker run -d --rm -p container_port:application_port image_id
With this docker container will run on detached mode , but we don't need to remove manually ( with this --rm command . If i stop that particular docker container this will automatically remove from docker list )


8. docker ps -a ( show all containers  )
